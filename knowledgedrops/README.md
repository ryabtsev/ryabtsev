# [OKD] Open Knowledge Drops

**Open Knowledge Drops (OKD)** is a project designed to act as a bridge between your personal knowledge and Large Language Models (LLMs).

The primary goals of OKD are:

1.  **Create Knowledge Snapshots:** To allow you to create small, concise snapshots of your own knowledge on any given topic. These "knowledge drops" act as a personal knowledge base.
2.  **Personalized LLM Interaction:** To serve as a proxy between you and an LLM. By providing your knowledge drops to the LLM, it can understand your context and provide more relevant and personalized responses.
3.  **Identify Knowledge Gaps:** To leverage the power of LLMs to analyze your existing knowledge drops and suggest potential gaps in your understanding of a specific area. This helps you identify what you need to learn next.
